At a time when the phrase “keep money out of politics” is popular and many campaigns prove their grassroots appeal by reporting small average donations, big money is playing an outsized role in our local city commission race. I had originally intended to report on all the candidates’ campaign financing, but it quickly became clear that Mike Dever has [far outraised all other candidates](https://lawrencekstimes.com/2023/07/28/lawrencecitycomm-primary-fundraising-2023/).

Readers who want to compare Dever’s reports to those of the other candidates can browse publicly available reports on [Douglas County’s website](http://apps.douglascountyks.org/mycounty/voting-and-elections/candidate-reports.aspx?category_id=city&subcategory_id=current).

In what follows, I report what I found when I dived into Devers' campaign finances — namely, that his donors are far from your average, working class Lawrencians. His most recent campaign finance report, filed in July of this year, reads like a who’s who of the wealthy in Lawrence, Kansas.

## Dever’s core donors - Not your average Lawrencians

![Dever's Donation Breakdown](/assets/img/dever-donation-breakdown.png)

|:---|---:|
| Total of Monetary Contributions | $30,561.00 |
| Total of In-Kind Contributions | $4,117.22 |
| Total of All Contributions | $34,678.22 |
| Total Contributors* | 147 |
| Average Monetary Contribution* | $235.91 |

*as reported, without grouping related entities or individuals at the same address.

Dever’s campaign has raised more than $30,000 from 136 donors and in-kind donations from another 11. Nearly two-thirds (65%, $22,693) of this overall support has come from businesses, executives, and individuals working in or retired from real estate, banking, and finance sectors.

It will come as no surprise to longtime Lawrencians that these roles do not align with the most common local occupations, which the [National Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/Oes/current/oes_29940.htm#00-0000) says are the following:  fast food and counter workers, customer service representatives, cashiers, retail sales workers, and secretaries/administrative assistants (except in law, medical and executive offices).

## Dever’s top contributors

Mashur and Mamie Haque each contributed $500 to Dever’s campaign and two companies listed at their address, The Collection LLC and Turnhalle LLC, also donated $500 each. According to [a 2019 article published in Fresh Take Florida](https://www.wuft.org/news/2019/04/10/florida-considered-public-money-for-troubled-executive/), Mashur Haque has a “history of bankruptcy, failed business ventures, legal problems and millions of dollars in past-due debts over the last decade.”

Dever's other top contributors include business owner Marcia Hannon Hill and Hill Family Investments LLC, each of which gave $500. Marcia Hill's husband Stephen Hill is the great-grandson of J.D. Bowersock. For those who are young, like the author, here is a quote from the [Journal World](https://12ft.io/proxy?&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww2.ljworld.com%2Fnews%2F2012%2Fdec%2F09%2Flawhorns-lawrence-bowersock-name-not-forgotten-fam) in 2012 that may provide some context:  “... once, you see, Lawrence wasn’t a university town as much as it was a J.D. Bowersock town.”

Besides the $1,000 from Hill and Hill Family Investments, The Bowersock Mills & Power Inc. contributed $500 and the owner of the firm, Sarah H. Hill-Nelson, contributed $200. This adds up to a grand total of $1,700.

## Other notable donors

Other notable donors, who are not necessarily “top donors," fall into several categories.

### Real Estate Notables

- Patrick McCandless, retired Broker/Co-Owner of Stephens Real Estate
- Mike McGrew, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of McGrew Real Estate

- Dale and Ron's Auto Service, Inc.
- Evan Williams Catering
- Free State Brewing Company
- Glory Days Pizza

### Contributors with Political Ties

- Kathleen Sebelius, former Kansas Governor
- Kim Wells, former chair of the Kansas Republican Party
- Ronald Gaches, retired Public Affairs Consultant and Lobbyist
- Larry McElwain, former CEO of the Lawrence Chamber of Commerce
- Jason Edmonds, current Chairman of the Lawrence Chamber of Commerce

As a Democrat, I'm surprised to see Kathleen Sebelius on this list, along with a former chair of the Kansas Republican Party. Several Democrats who would benefit from Sebelius’ support are also running for City Commission, and I would have hoped that our former Governor would have placed their interests, and the interests of the constituencies they serve, above the interests that Mike Dever so clearly represents.

## Who would Dever serve?

Mike Dever has long had the support of monied interests. In 2007, the [Journal World](https://www2.ljworld.com/news/2007/feb/12/board_realtors_endorses_commission_candidates/) reported that “For the first time in its 42-year history, the Lawrence Board of Realtors is endorsing candidates for Lawrence City Commission.”. Mike Dever was one of three candidates to get this endorsement. The same year, Dever also received support from Kansas Realtors Political Action Committee ($200) and Board of Realtors Political Action Committee ($500) alongside donations from many of his current backers including Sarah Hill-Nelson, Bill and Cindy Self, Mark Gonzales, and Michael McGrew.

Dever's website says that he is running for the Commission again to develop "cohesive policies" to address the needs of "unhoused and unsheltered citizens." If that is, in fact, his principal concern, voters deserve to know:

What “cohesive policies” does Dever advocate?

How would these policies help those who are struggling with the more general housing crisis?  I'm thinking of those of us who are struggling to make rent or relying on help from friends — service workers, veterans, seniors, single parents, and many others.

What will Dever do to ensure that truly affordable housing for those on fixed incomes is permanently available?

What solutions does Dever offer for those of us — more than 50% — who rent, seldom with prospects of home ownership?

What solutions does he offer for our immigrant neighbors?

My dive into Devers' campaign finances, and donors, leaves me deeply skeptical that he will serve us as we should be served, with the knowledge of housing policy and the gumption that we need from our commissioners. When I get the chance, I plan to ask him these questions myself and see what he says. You can do the same.
