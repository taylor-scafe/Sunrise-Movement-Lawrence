For the last 2 years. Evergy has promised to close their coal power plant at the Lawrence Energy Center. They have now "postponed" this closure until 2028. In the era of grants for green energy, Evergy is dragging their heels in helping our grid go green.

You can help by reaching out to your local officials and demand that Evergy removes their dependence on fossil fuels as fast as possible.
